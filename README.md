# Data Structures

## Overview
A data structure is a fundamental concept in computer science, providing a systematic way to organize and store data for efficient access and modification. There are two main categories of data structures: linear and non-linear.

### Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures arrange data elements sequentially. They can be further categorized into static and dynamic structures.

#### Static Data Structure
Static data structures have a fixed memory size, making them suitable for situations where the size of the data is known in advance.

#### Dynamic Data Structure
Dynamic data structures, on the other hand, do not have a fixed size, allowing for flexibility in handling varying amounts of data.

### Non-linear Data Structures
Non-linear data structures organize data elements in a way that is not sequential. This introduces complexity but is essential for certain types of applications.<br>
